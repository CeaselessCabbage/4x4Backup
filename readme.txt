*********************************************************************
CHOOSING THE PROPER RENDERER FOR YOUR VIDEO CARD

3Dfx cards - If you have any Voodoo based cards (excluding Voodoo4 or Voodoo5), you must use 16 bit color graphics using DirectX and OpenGL. Glide is supported with Voodoo2, Voodoo3, Voodoo4, and Voodoo5 in 16 bit color only. There is no Glide support for Voodoo Banshee - but Voodoo Banshee cards should work fine in DirectX mode using the latest drivers from 3Dfx. There is no support for Voodoo1 cards.

Glide - Glide only works with Voodoo cards. If your card is not based upon a 3Dfx Voodoo chipset, Glide will not work.

OpenGL - OpenGL is supported on most cards, but if you have any trouble using it please switch to using DirectX. Use OpenGL "at your own risk". Although the OpenGL drivers on many cards work better than DirectX, there are many video cards that have OpenGL drivers that are unstable. This means that 4x4 may crash, but nothing bad will happen to your computer.

DirectX - You should install DirectX7a or higher on your computer to insure that 4x4 Evolution will work correctly. If you have DirectX7 installed, you should upgrade to DirectX7a. If you are unsure what version of DirectX you have installed, visit http://www.microsoft.com/direcx and download and install the latest version of DirectX.

Windows NT 4.0 will be limited to OpenGL or software rendering.

Compatibility - 4x4 Evolution has been written for and tested with a large variety of video cards. We have made every effort to try to insure that we will be compatible with the majority of the video cards available today. Unfortunately, because of the large variety of video card manufacturers, the range of supported features on different chipsets, and the ever-changing video card driver situation, it is impossible to guarantee that 4x4 Evolution will work correctly on every video card, or that all features will be supported on all video cards. It is possible that 4x4 Evolution may show some graphical anomalies, or may have limited graphic features depending upon your video card. 

Drivers - To make sure that you have the best performance in 4x4 Evolution, you should download and install the latest video and sound drivers for your video and sound cards. If your drivers are more than 3 months old, they are most likely very out of date.

Recommended Video Cards - The following is a list of recommended (NOT required) video cards for use with 4x4 Evolution:  Nvidia Geforce2, 3Dfx Voodoo5, Matrox G400, ATI Radeon, Nvidia Geforce, 3Dfx Voodoo4, Matrox G200, Nvidia TNT1/TNT2, 3Dfx Voodoo3. Again, these are only recommended video cards - if your video card is not on this list it is still highly likely that 4x4 Evolution will work well with your video card using OpenGl, DirectX, or Glide.

GENERAL GAME DESCRIPTION

4x4 Evolution is an off-road racing game. 4x4 Evolution allows you to take your favorite SUV or truck and race it in realistic looking off-road locations. To accurately capture the feel of off-road racing we designed the game so that there are no artificial walls to keep you on the track. In 4x4 Evolution the tracks are completely open and you can drive anywhere that your truck will take you. There are no walls to confine you, so this is a race from checkpoint to checkpoint. If you can find a better route than the racetrack itself - take it. In order to find out where the next checkpoint is follow the green arrow at the top of your screen (F key by default toggles it on and off). If the arrow is green you are headed in the right direction. If the arrow is red you are heading in the wrong direction. The upper left hand of the screen shows important information such as what position you are in, your time compared to the last lap, and what lap you are on. The map on the upper right hand side of the screen gives you a general idea of the course and where the other trucks are. Watch the map carefully as your competitors do not always drive on the track. If you see a competitor taking a short cut, you might want to try follow (it may be a faster path). The lower portion of the screen shows you your tachometer, speedometer, and gear position.

*********************************************************************
TIPS

If you ever get lost or stuck in a place you cannot get out of (like a deep ravine) use the reset position key (H by default) to reset your position to the last checkpoint that you drove through.

At night you can use the headlight key (L by default)  to turn your headlights off or on. We recommend driving with your headlights on, because it can get pretty darn dark out there - especially when it gets foggy.

If you change the weather setting to rain, it would be wise to change your tires to a deep cut. 

If you are racing in the snow, you won't be very successful unless you switch to studded tires.

Different tire treads work better on different tracks. Experiment to see what combination will give you the best time.

Just like in real life, when your tires are off the ground you loose speed. You should always try your best to keep your tires on the ground (not jump) even if this means slowing down a bit. It is sometimes faster to slow down at a hill so that you may accelerate down the other side, than to hit the hill at full speed and jump down the other side (loosing speed the entire time).

Quick Race allows you to try every track, and practice getting good times. Use this as a tool to prepare you for Career Mode.

Use your Career Mode money wisely. Upgrading the appearance of your truck is fun, but it doesn't make it any faster.

Each race in a series increases in difficulty. To keep competitive, if you have won money in the prior race, you may want to upgrade your truck before attempting the next race.

It never hurts to explore the track for faster routes to checkpoints - you also may find a surprise or two.

If you do not seem to be accelerating properly, ease up on the gas a bit. As you upgrade your vehicle the power of your vehicle significantly increases. If you just mash on the gas, it is likely that you will not go very fast because your tires are spinning in place.

It is always best, when racing off road, to have a 4WD vehicle. If you feel like you aren't getting the proper traction, make sure that your vehicle is in 4WD (the 4 key by default cycles you through between 4WD High, 4WD Low, and 2WD).  If you have a 2WD vehicle, you can't shift into 4WD (in case you were wondering...)

Running into objects or other vehicles can slow you down significantly. Avoid running into objects whenever possible.

Use the Emergency Brake to help spin the back of your vehicle when trying to take tight turns.

Experiment with your vehicle settings. You might find that your personal driving style benefits from oversteering or understeering.

We have done drop tests in an attempt to make 4x4 Evolution have very realistic physics. Although it may seem like you are "floating" a bit when making a big jump - rest assured that you are falling at the correct velocity. The floating effect is a perceptual illusion - this happens because what we expect should happen is not what actually happens. Most of us will never see this in real life because we aren't going to be taking our real $40,000 vehicles off of 100ft jump. :)

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q: I have Windows NT 4.0. Can I run 4x4 Evolution?
A: Yes. You must use OpenGL or software rendering because Windows NT 4.0 does not support DirectX 7a or higher. 

Q: I have slightly delayed sound effects. Oh yeah, I see this on Windows NT 4.0.
A: Because of the way DirectSound is working with NT 4.0, the effects can have a small delay. We are sorry, but there was no way around this at time of release.

Q: Because of the previous two questions, I think I should upgrade to Windows 2000. Is that OK?
A: Yes. Windows 2000 is a good solution for current Windows NT 4.0 users (in our opinion).

Q: My video drivers are really old. Will they work without me upgrading them?
A: It is possible, but we recommend that you upgrade your video and sound drivers before trying to play 4x4 Evolution.

Q: I use OpenGL and the great truck pictures do not show up on the loading screens.
A: This is a known issue. Because of time constraints, there wasn't time to fix this before release. This is the only part of the game that you will not properly see due to using OpenGL.

Q: I have tried OpenGL and DirectX. OpenGL works better than DirectX. Is there any reason to not use OpenGL since it works great?
A: Nope. Use whatever you like.

Q: I have tried OpenGL and DirectX. DirectX works better than OpenGL. Is there any reason to not use DirectX since it works great?
A: Nope. Use whatever you like.

Q: When I try to use OpenGL, I get an error message and/or something looks funny in 4x4 Evolution. What can I do about this?? Oh yeah, it works using DirectX.
A: You can try upgrading your video drivers. If that doesn't work, you should switch to using DirectX instead of OpenGL. We have found that OpenGL works great with most video cards, but there are still plenty of card and/or drivers that have OpenGL problems.

Q: Is it true that there are Mac and Dreamcast versions of 4x4 Evolution? I hear we can race them on line and you can't tell the difference!!
A: It is true. You can race on line against Mac and Dreamcast. The only limitation with the Dreamcast version is that you are limited to 4 participants in the race.

Q: My DirectX version is less than DirectX 7a. Will 4x4 Evolution work on my machine?
A: No. You must upgrade to DirectX7a (or higher) for 4x4 Evolution to work correctly. Visit http://www.microsoft.com/directx to download the latest version of DirectX.
Q: I have controller problems. They just won't work right. I have DirectX7.
A: Although you have DirectX7, you need to make sure that you upgrade to DirectX7a. DirectX7 has problems with DirectInput, and that is what we are using to help us to work with the largest variety of controllers. They fixed the majority of controller problems in DirectX7a.

Q: My controller doesn't work properly. Or at least I don't think so.
A: If it is a gamepad, try setting it up as a joystick. Experiment. Due to the large variety of controllers on the market, we tried to make things as compatible as possible, but some times you still have to set up a gamepad as a joystick, and a wheel as a joystick.

Q: How can I make my own tracks for the game?
A: Check out http://www.4x4evolution.com for a track editor for 4x4 Evolution. We will be releasing a track editor shortly after the game is released.

Q: 4x4 Evolution is, by far, the greatest game I have ever owned. Has Terminal Reality made other great games that I can buy and play?
A: Why thank you and yes. Terminal Reality has also created: Nocturne, Blair Witch Volume One - Rustin Parr, Fly!, Fly!2K, Monster Truck Madness I & II, CART Precision Racing, Terminal Velocity, Hellbender, Fury3, and F!-Zone.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT 4x4 COPY PROTECTION

The 4x4 Evolution Install CD must be in the drive to run 4x4 Evolution.

Administrator rights for Windows 2000
In order to run  4X4 Evolution, Windows 2000 users should make sure they have administrative rights on the system they are logged in with.

Virus Protection & Crash protection Software:
Mc Afee Virus Software First Aid and Guard Dog may cause crashes or lockups during game play. 

Kenwood CD-ROM drives: 
Kenwood TrueX drive users should get the Firmware Update available for most models of Kenwood TrueX drives. Kenwood has recently released a firmware update for the 40X Multi-Beam, 42 TrueX, 52 TrueX and 60 TrueX, 72 TrueX CD ROM drives available on Kenwoods firmware downloads page (http://www.kenwoodtech.com/downloads.html)
     
Getting a "Blue Screen" when launching the application: 
Systems that receive a "Blue Screen" error message when attempting to launch 4x4 Evolution may be infected with the Windows CIH virus. This virus is one of the more common ones found in applications downloaded off the Internet or other external locations. 

Please make sure that you are using the most current update for your virus detection software. In some cases it may be possible that your virus detection software cannot detect it (see below). If the virus is detected, you will want to clean the infected files, not delete them. Deleting the infected files could cause serious problems with your system. After you have cleaned those files, the programs that were infected must be re-installed in order for them to work properly. 

If your virus detection software is not able to detect or clean the infected files, or if you do not have any virus detection software, then please try the DOS version of AVP. Go to http://www.avp.ch/E/faq/cihfaq.htm and follow the step-by-step instructions on that page. An evaluation version of AVP for DOS is available at http://www.avp.ch. Click on the "Downloads" icon at the bottom of the page, then "evaluation versions". Select the DOS version of AVP and download it. You can then use AVP as described in the instructions. We have found this to be a reliable way of detecting and cleaning the CIH virus. NOTE: Reformatting your hard drive may not get rid of the CIH virus. 

Disable the Game Port Joystick
Users with the Creative PCI64 should download the latest PCI64 drivers from Creative Labs Support. 
If the problem persists then disable your Game Port / Joystick. 

          Right Click on My Computer 
          Select Properties 
          Click on Device Manager Tab 
          Expand the Sound Video and Game controllers branch 
          Right click Game Port/Joystick and select Properties 
          Mark the checkbox "Disable in Active Profile" 
          Click on OK
