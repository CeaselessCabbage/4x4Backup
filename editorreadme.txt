4x4 Evolution Editor Beta

IMPORTANT: THE PATCH MUST BE INSTALLED FIRST

The 4x4 Evolution patch must be installed before running the editor or it will NOT work correctly.  The editor uses the updated rendering code installed with the patch.

If you have already installed the patch then it is not necessary to install it again.

The 4X4ED.EXE and EDITOR.POD files go in the same game folder as 4X4.EXE.  To run the editor simply execute 4X4ED.EXE.

The EDITOR.POD is self-mounting.  It does not need to be added to the POD.INI file.

The 4x4 Evolution Editor.doc has been included to help you get started using the editor.
