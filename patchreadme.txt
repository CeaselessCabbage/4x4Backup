=======================================
Items addressed in this patch (build 56) are:
 
1. Profile reset. Profiles were being reset to their default value even when tampering was not evident. This has been fixed.
 
2. A bug in Time Attack was discovered by our testers after release. This has not been reported by the general public, but is fixed in this version.
 
3. Enhancements to  DirectX and OpenGL rendering. This should improve frame rate on some systems.
 
4. An additional suspension type is allowed for custom trucks only.
 
5. The maximum number of custom trucks has been raised from 14 to 25.
